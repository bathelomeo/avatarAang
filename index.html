        <h3>Avatar</h3>
        <p>
    <em>
    The movie is wack.
    D'nt come in my house talking about them blue aliens. 
    Avatar has four nations.
    Aang is the combination of it.    
    Avatar is the best avatar their ever was and also do not step foot in my house talking about that korra.
    Shortly before the beginning of the Hundred Year War, Aang was frozen in an iceberg for a hundred years; he later emerged, still biologically twelve years old, into a world engulfed by war.[3] During his absence, the Fire Nation had waged war upon the other nations and managed to completely wipe out the pacifistic Air Nomads. It fell to Aang, the Avatar and the last airbender, to end the War by mastering the other three elements and defeating Fire Lord Ozai.

        Well there was kuruk he never took any thing siriously 
        He never even took  practicing water bending seriously 
        Until some spirit coackroach came along and killed his wife.
        Next was kiosi who was an earth bender 
        All i can say is she was to interested in muder.
        After that was roku these guy said one word and for 100 years their was a war 
        Then he tried to prevent it and failed terribly.
        Then we have yangcheng i mean i cant say any thing bad about her because she gave wisdom to her future lives and 
        she did her part of the job well.
        Now we have Aang after roku he had to stop the war find love dill with genocide(<strong>kiling a whole nation</strong>) and learn all four bendings.

            Earth is my my favourite.
            Because even though right now you may think its just floating rocks.
            Did you know that if you know if your an earth bender you can lava bend 
            Did you know that if you know if your an earth bender you can metal bend.
            Fire bending came from the dragons technically and 
            Did you know that if you have fire bending you can lighiting bend and 
            Did you know that if you know if your a fire bender you can ridirect it lightning.
            Did you know that air bending can be use in many ways even bloking you from falls 
            With and controling tornadoes and even fight.
            Water bending is controlling water even the water in the air 
            You can water bend from plants and from plantes and trees and : 
            Did you know if you are a water bender since water is in the body  you can blood bend.

        The avatar after him was korra.
        Why i do not like her is because she masterd the elements to fast and she used the avatar state for a race.
        Second she is to rough.
        Third tenzin bumi (katara) (aangs wife ) and kaiya are G's.
        And i dont like it because because until you 18 years you can not finish the show.
