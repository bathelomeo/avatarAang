        well there was kuruk he never took any thing siriously not even practicing water bending until some coackroach came along and killed his wife.
        Next was kiosi who was an earth bender, all i can say is she was to interested in muder.
        After that was roku these guy said one word and for 100 years their was a war then he tried to prevent it and failed terribly.
        Then we have yangcheng i mean i cant say any thing bad about her because she gave wisdom to her future lives and she did her part of the job well.
            Now we have Aang after roku he had to stop the war find love dill with genocide(<strong>kiling a whole nation</strong>) and learn all four bendings.

            Earth is my my favourite because even though right now you may think its just floating rocks
            Did you know that if you know if your an earth bender you can lava bend and metal bend.
            Fire bending came from the dragons technically and did you know that if you have fire bending you can lighiting bend and ridirect it.
            Air bending did you know that air bending can be use in many ways even bloking you from falls and controling tornadoes and even fight.
            Water bending is controlling water even from mid air and from plantes and trees and did you know that since you drink water you can blood bend.

                <em>
                The avatar after him was korra.
                why i do not like her is because she masterd the elements to fast and she used the avatar state for a race.
                Second she is to rough.
                Third tenzin bumi (katara) (aangs wife ) and kaiya are G's.
                And i dont like it because because until you 18 years you can not finish the show.
