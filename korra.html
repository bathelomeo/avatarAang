            The Legend of Korra comics are a continuation of the Nickelodeon animated television series of The Legend of Korra, created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. 
            Chronologically, the comics take place after the series finale, "The Last Stand". 
            They are published by Dark Horse Comics, the same company that publishes the Avatar: The Last Airbender comics.
            Short The Legend of Korra comics have appeared in Dark Horse's Free Comic Book Day 2016 and 2018 issues
            The Legend of Korra: Turf Wars is a three-part graphic novel series written by Michael Dante DiMartino, with art by Irene Koh. 
            It serves as a canonical continuation of the animated television series The Legend of Korra, created by DiMartino and Bryan
            Konietzko. 
            The graphic novel trilogy is set after the show's final season, with Avatar Korra dealing with the aftermath of Kuvira's attack on Republic City, while also exploring her new relationship with Asami Sato.
            Following the conclusion of The Legend of Korra, DiMartino was touched by positive reactions to Korra and Asami's relationship and felt that there were more stories to tell with the show's characters. 
            Although the shift to the comic book medium was a challenge for DiMartino, it gave the creative team more freedom to explore LGBT narratives. 
            The series was announced in July 2015 and The Legend of Korra: Turf Wars â€“ Part One was published by Dark Horse Comics on July 26, 2017. 
            Part Two was published on January 17, 2018, followed by Part Three on August 22, 2018. 
            Part One and Two were the publisher's best-selling graphic novels of 2017 and 2018 respectively. 
            A library edition collecting the three volumes was released on March 13, 2019.
            The Legend of Korra: Turf Wars received positive reviews for its handling of Korra and Asami's romance. 
            Critics also praised DiMartino's writing and Koh's art for evoking the style of the original series. <strong>And my brother is the best</strong>.

        Avatar Korra is the title lead character in Nickelodeon's animated television series The Legend of Korra (a sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender), in which she is depicted as the current incarnation of Raava's Avatar the spiritual embodiment of balance and change responsible for maintaining peace and harmony in the world. 
        She is the immediate reincarnation of Avatar Aang (title character and main protagonist from the original series). 
        The character was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and is voiced by Janet Varney.
        Korra debuted in the first episode of The Legend of Korra, "Welcome to Republic City", originally airing on Nickelodeon on April 14, 2012. 
        At the start of the series, she meets Bolin and Mako after arriving in Republic City, where she first experiences independence after living a secluded life of training, led by the Order of the White Lotus.
        Korra, now seventeen, and having mastered three of the elements, needs to learn airbending from the only living airbending master, Aang's son, Tenzin. 
        Korra moves to Republic City to go after him following a brief encounter with Katara, being taken in by Tenzin and meeting both Mako and Bolin before joining their pro-bending team. 
        After saving Bolin and having her first sighting of Amon, Korra's romantic struggles lead to difficulty with the pro-bending team, which the group recovers from to successfully win their match and make it to the finals, where they are defeated and Amon strikes with his group of followers, the Equalists. 
        Korra afterward discovers Hiroshi Sato's ties to the Equalists, then allowing Asami Sato, Bolin and Mako to live with her, forming a team with the group that Councilman Tarrlok breaks up by arresting the others and revealing himself as a bloodbender in an encounter with Korra where he subdues her.
        She is locked in a secluded cabin that holds her for a short time before she breaks out once it is ambushed by Amon and his Equalists, the group launching an assault on Republic City that Korra and the others are overpowered in, forcing them to retreat until General Iroh and the United Forces come to the city as reinforcements, who are also overwhelmed. 
        Following saving Tenzin and his children and seemingly losing her bending of three of the elements to Amon, Korra engages in a battle with Amon where she emerges victorious thanks to her airbending, having the other elements restored by Aang and in doing so gaining the power to restore bending as well.
        after six months of bending revolution she found out that she had a uncle.
